## üîç Project Overview

This project explores the theory, design, and simulation of **Polar Codes** ‚Äî the first class of error-correcting codes proven to achieve the capacity of symmetric binary-input memoryless channels, introduced by **Erdal Arƒ±kan**. It combines both theoretical foundations and practical implementation of polar encoding and decoding schemes.

## üß† Key Topics Covered

- Channel Polarization and use of the **Bhattacharyya parameter** to measure channel reliability  
- Implementation of **Matrix-based** and **Tree-based** Polar Encoding with complexity comparisons  
- Design and analysis of **Successive Cancellation (SC)** and **Successive Cancellation List (SCL)** decoding  
- Integration of **CRC-Aided SCL (CA-SCL)** decoding to improve error-correction performance  
- Simulation of Polar Codes under **BI-AWGN channel** using **BPSK modulation**  
- Demonstration of Polar Codes achieving **Shannon's Channel Capacity**  
- Study of advanced techniques like **Large-Small Sorting** and **Reed-Muller Node Identification** for decoding optimization
